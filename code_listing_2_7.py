# 1. Take the number of points one team is ahead.
points_str = input('Enter the lead in points: ')
points_remaining_int = int(points_str)

# 2. Subtract three.
lead_calculation_float = float(points_remaining_int - 3)

# 3. Add a half-point if the team that is ahead has the ball,
#    and subtract a half-point if the other team has the ball.
has_ball_str = input('Does the lead team have the ball (Yes or No): ')

if has_ball_str == 'Yes':
    lead_calculation_float += 0.5
else:

# (Numbers less than zero become zero)
if lead_calculation_float < 0:
    lead_calculation_float = 0

# 4. Square that.

# 5. If the result is greater than the number of seconds left in the game,
#    the lead is safe.
